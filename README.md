## Usage

Run the bot's script for it to appear online in the server and accept chat
commands in the `#roles-bot` channel.  Once online, the bot accepts the
following commands.

**Warning**: Care must be taken not to manually update user roles during any of
these commands.

### Command `!backup`
Captures the role assignments of the server's users and responds with a
UTF8-encoded gzipped CSV file attachment structured as follows:

```csv
"Username","Display Name","Role 1 Name","Role 2 Name",…
"user_1","User One",1,0,…
"Usr2#1234","User Two",0,0,…
```

### Command `!restore`
If this command's message is accompanied by a gzipped CSV file attachment in the
same format as generated by `!backup` or `!apply`, then the bot attempts to
revert display names permissions of listed users.  Users and roles not present
in the file are not affected.

### Command `!apply`
Applies user display-name and role changes from a simplified [mentor-accessible
Google Sheet](
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12uITMXrY9U_Utq619Asrl-UaEYbTu896KDlj-u8ckMM/edit?usp=sharing
).  Administrator users are not affected.

1.  Update the spreadsheet's "Users" tab with student names, Discord usernames,
    and active teams.
    *   Rows with missing Discord usernames are ignored.
    *   Rows with no active teams will be transitioned to alumni if the
        corresponding student was previously a team member.
    *   Rows without a first name will not result in a Discord display-name
        change.

2.  Send the `!apply` command.

3.  Before any changes, the bot responds with a pre-update backup attachment
    like the `!backup` command.

4.  The bot applies updates to non-administrators based on spreadsheet contents
    as follows:
    *   If a student's first name is provided, their display names change to
        that plus a last initial if also provided.
    *   `@Active`: Students assigned to a team gain this role, and others lose
        it.
    *   `@Alumni`: Students assigned to a team lose this role.  If a student
        leaves a team and does not join another, then they gain this role.
    *   Team roles: Students assigned to a team gain its corresponding team role
        and lose all other team roles.
    *   Team alumni roles: Students removed from a team gain its corresponding
        team alumni role.

5.  Finally, the bot's response also includes a post-update backup attachment.


## Terms of Use

Backup CSV files generated by this bot must only be used for recovery
purposes by this same bot.  Server administrators should delete backup files
after their useful lifetime as they contain Discord handles, first names, and
last initials.  Scraping this data from Discord servers for purposes other than
interaction with this bot is against [the Discord Terms of Service](
https://discord.com/terms ).

This bot does not persist any user data other than the backup files that it
generates on request.  No data is shared with third parties.  Because this bot
